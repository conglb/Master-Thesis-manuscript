Email: [Master Thesis][222100012] Propose the research topic ""
To: Stefan, Florian

Dear Professor Ludkte, Professor Sprenger,

I am Ba Cong Le, a Computer Science International student at Department of Computer Science.
After discussing via emai. Both professors are happy to supervise the topic and agree with an arrangement where Professor Ludkte would be the first reviewer and Professor Sprenger is the second reviewer and the main supervisor.

With this e-mail I would like to submit the proposal for my dissertation “A Data-Processing Framework for Operational Vessel Time-Series Data”. The proposal for the dissertation is attached to this e-mail. It contains a brief introduction to the research topic. 

As spoke earlier, the thesis encompasses the work to create a pipepline to automate/simply/modernize the process of collecting, cleaning, storing and visualize the maritime time-based data. At the moment, I am trying to develop the product with the maximum level of automation and the largest data possible. In plan, the final manuscript will be completed and submited by February 28, 2025.

For supervision, I would like to send you this link (https://quixotic-energy-9bc.notion.site/Master-thesis-222100012-e0de2a68a676425e8465f7abdc19081c) where you can follow my working progress.

I understand the significance of this petition and look forward to receive your feedback from you.

Kind regards
Cong Le

========================

After spending time reviewing literature and following up the DigitShip backend development, I commit on the thesis topic of data science for data on vessels.
I don't know whether my decision may affect the MMG expectations or not. If we can meet with MMG to discuss soon would be great.

For my part, I think I received much support from your side and I can work independently on the thesis with minor comment on technical from CS's supervisor and writing advise from MSF's supervisor. Prof. Lüdtke agreed to be a formal 1st reviewer but with no significance supervisor. Does it work for you?
According to the schedule, Proposal will be delivered to you before 04.09.2024. In specific, there are the scope, objectives, and overview of the thesis. Your extra requirements would be taken to the proposal.




- sẽ xóa phần Limitation (imperfect data), project của tôi có thể xử lý được cả imperfect data.
- tao đã update proposal bản mới.
- hãy review nó và nói với tao như vậy là đủ để gửi cho 1st reviewer
- tao sẽ trích dẫn những phần của Dr.Jabary and Msc.Iven.
- xin một buổi gặp trực tiếp


- Thanks for your repy.
- Regarding the part with Dr, I will talk with him to define what parts that need to be cited.
- I have reviewed the software and the document and decide to remove the "not support imperfect data" line. The software should be able to handle imperfection in input data.
- In attachment is an improved draft version of the proposal. Can youu please go through it and give me feedback?




=================
I look forward to hearing from you.





I am writing you to propose a work model for my master thesis in Computer Science International, with you as the second advisor.
As spoke earlier this year, the thesis encompasses the work to create a pipepline to automate/simply/modernize to up to scurrent standards and practices/improve the process of collecting, filtering and storing of maritime time-based data.
The resulted product could potentially integrated in the internal workflow of a data holder, such as MMG who has expressed their interest in the project in a meeting session.

As requested by you in our last meeting, I approached Prof. ABC to be my first reviewer. 
However, he could only offer a pseudo position where he would formally act as the first reviewer while leaving the majority of the supervisory work to the second reviewer.
I am confident that, having completed a significant amount of technical tasks related to the project, I can complete the work with minimal IT-related guidance, although I am grateful for any support from your (naval) expertise and cooperation with MMG and other partners.

If you agree with this arrangement, I can submit a proposal before September and start working on the thesis immediately afterward. Your feedback on the draft versions of the proposal is of course very much welcome.
