%This thesis proposes a framework for efficient saving/ modernize/ simplify the process of collecting, formatting, storing, visualize of operational vessel data. 


The proposed thesis focuses on developing a comprehensive data-processing framework tailored for operational vessel time-series data (OVD). As the maritime industry undergoes digitalization, an increasing amount of vessel data is generated from sensors, navigation systems, and operational logs. However, a lack of standardization across different fleet management systems creates challenges in processing, storing, and analyzing this data efficiently. To address these issues, the thesis proposes a scalable, modular framework that can handle large volumes of OVD, ensuring interoperability across various data sources. The framework encompasses data collection, cleaning, storage, and presentation, leveraging InfluxDB database, to manage time-series data. A customizable dashboard interface is also developed to enable data analysis and gain insights. 


Keywords: operational vessel data, marine data science, AIS data, data-processing framework
