Lastly, the solution can facilitate collaboration between researchers and industry professionals by providing a standardized platform for data sharing and analysis. The frameworkâ€™s ability to handle diverse data formats and integrate various data sources makes it an ideal tool for collaborative research projects, where multiple stakeholders may need to analyze the same dataset from different perspectives. This can lead to faster innovation in areas like vessel design, routing algorithms, and environmental modeling, further advancing the maritime industry.

In summary, the proposed data-processing framework serves as a powerful tool for maritime companies, researchers, and regulators. Its ability to handle complex, large-scale operational data and transform it into meaningful insights has the potential to significantly enhance operational efficiency, safety, sustainability, and compliance across the industry.
